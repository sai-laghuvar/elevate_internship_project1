Music Genre Classification using Deep Learning
Introduction

Music genre classification is the process of automatically categorizing music into genres such as rock, jazz, classical, pop, and more.

With the rapid growth of digital music platforms, automatic genre classification plays an important role in:

🎧 Music recommendation systems

📂 Playlist creation

🎶 Music organization

This project builds a Deep Learning-based Music Genre Classification system that predicts the genre of an audio file using feature extraction and a neural network classifier.

📖 Abstract

The objective of this project is to design a Music Genre Classification system using Deep Learning techniques.

Dataset Used: GTZAN Music Genre Dataset

Total Genres: 10

Feature Extraction: MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)

Model: Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

Framework: TensorFlow & Keras

Train-Test Split: 80-20

The system successfully classifies music into 10 genres and performs well on unseen test data.
